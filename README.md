# Psychic-Game

This is a pre-cursor to the word-guess game. Almost the same JS logic built here was used in the Word-Guess game. 

## Getting Started
This project is a beta version of the word-guess game. On keypress, the user needs to figure out the letter which computer has randomly chosen. The user has 9 tries to figure out the letter. 

Below is a screen shot. Dont forget to check out the [Word-Guess game](https://anw1986.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/)
